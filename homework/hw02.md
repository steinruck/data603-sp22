## NoSQL Databases and Data Lakes

Database Management Systems (DBMS) interact with databases and facilitate access. Traditional DBMSs use a relational model, with tables and Structured Query Langueage (SQL). Theys encounter issues with horizontal scaling and unstructured data. Alternatively, NoSQL databases can store semi-structured and unstructured data, they don't use SQL or a relational model, and often mazimize availability.

### NoSQL Database Types
> #### Key-Value 
> Key-value stores use hash tables and unique identifiers. Applications requesting data must know how to structure it. They are efficient and scalable.

> #### Columnar
> Data is stored in columns of the same type, each in a separate location. Ordered data maps to other columns. Load performance can be slow since each column is written separately, though they work well for aggragate functions.

> #### Document-Oriented
> Data is stored in documents with unique identifiers and metadata indicating structure. These have grown in popularity due to flexibility and scalability. 

> #### Graph
> A subcategory of document store models that highlight the relationship between documents. Used for fraud detection and recommendation engines.

### Data Lakes
Hold large amounts of data in a central location using a flat architecture. Use metadata tags to locate and retrieve data. They are nonproprietary, scalable, inexpensive, flexible, and an open format that many applications can use. They can sometimes be unreliable, slow, and unsecure, but lakehouses can help mitigate. These use similar features to data warehouses, which allow traditional analytics and other methods to work in the same system.
